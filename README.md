# Binary-Tree-Traversals

🌲 Binary Tree Traversals in C++
-
This project demonstrates four fundamental types of binary tree traversals in C++, implemented using recursive and iterative approaches wherever applicable. These traversals are essential for exploring or processing tree-based data structures efficiently.

🚀 Traversal Types Covered
-
🔹 1. Preorder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)

Starts from the root and visits each node before its subtrees.

Commonly used for:

Copying trees

Prefix expression evaluation



🔹 2. Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)

Visits left subtree first, then the root, and then the right subtree.

Especially important for:

Retrieving data in sorted order from a Binary Search Tree (BST)

🔹 3. Postorder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)

Processes the children before the node itself.

Commonly used in:

Deleting trees

Postfix expression evaluation

🔹 4. Level Order Traversal (BFS)

Traverses the tree level by level, from top to bottom.

Implemented using a queue.

Useful in:

Finding shortest path in unweighted trees

Tree serialization
